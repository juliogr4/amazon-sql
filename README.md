This is the Amazon clone database model in SQL.

In this model, we'll be able to create product variations of any kind. Moreover, based on the selected category, we'll allow specific variations for a product.

This project is still in progress, and I aim to develop it using the following technologies:

- SQL Server (in progress)

- Angular

- C#

Python (possibly for product recommendations - still learning)
